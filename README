Diode_WasBuild.sh sript downloads and builds Classic McEliece's 4th Round submission for a post-quantum-cryptography algorithm for wasm32 from https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-4-submissions

It also builds its dependacies, OpenSSL and XKCP/keccak for wasm32.

At the end it will create the Classic_McEliece_wasm.tar.gz archive with the WebAssembly wasm, html and js. 

Its intended use, at the moment, is to have access to the algorithm for the Diode messanger project.

The included Makefile is used to build the wasm binary.

To build for the first time, use:
./Diode_WasBuild.sh -xtd

This will build the wasm binary with the algorithm and its dependacies discussed above.

The available script argument flags are:
	-d ) to clone and build openssl and XKCP (dependacies)
	-x ) to turn on -O3 compiler optimizations (recommended)
	-t ) to call make with --trace
	-c ) to call make clean for the algorithm build

The necesary packages to build the McEliece's algorithm and its dependacies are (and maybe not lmited to):

	emscripten (toolchain for wasm binaries)
	make
	xsltproc
	perl
	tar
	git
	wget

As it stands this isn't fully tested, it's not intended for long term use or for production, just to start the project off.

In addition some src files are provided with functions to be called from JavaScript, check the header files in include directory for documentation.
